    <td>Last week, we made our code "Concatenate", where you put all of the separate code into a string.  This still needed to be decoded, but first we had to separate it into the separate letters, to be decoded. The code then is able to be decoded. I split the code down, by taking the left x the number of letters along, and then taking the rightmost letter from that string.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was able to see how to do all of these sections, and then even if I didn't, I was able to figure it out, as it was very logical. There was a lot of things to do, but I was able to figure out what code to put in, but with the people around me, we were able to figure it out. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The next lesson, we will be able to go through out blogs, and so we may not be able to work our code as much. We will be able to do whatever we need to do next, to be able to make it more advanced, but I will be able to do whatever this is, as I am not behind on anything.</td>
