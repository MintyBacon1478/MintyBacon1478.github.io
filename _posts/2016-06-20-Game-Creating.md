In today's lesson we were mainly teaching people to have common sense.  Many people had not even bothered to do their homework and hand it on time!

We spent over 20 minutes showing people how to do simple things, like put their code into a document, and hand it in.  I found this very boring.  Lewis and I just worked on our game for most of the lesson though, and it is coming on nicely!
