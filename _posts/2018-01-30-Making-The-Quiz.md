    <td>We all did not know where to start with our quiz, so we all went to the front and Mr. Keen showed us all of the basic ideas behind a quiz, and how we already knew most of it. We were all reminded of the basics; you define many functions and variables, and then incorporate all of these into one main function you fun at the end, called main(). I also remember we had a lot of good code about inputting answers, which would be good for this quiz, in my older programs, especially the maths machine we made a few weeks ago.  In the maths machine, I already a lot of code which I could simply copy, as it was all about inputs of a's, b’s, c’s and d’s. </td>

    <td>I did not think that I knew what to do to start the quiz, yet once Mr Keen had properly explained all of the logic, and how that we already knew all of it, it became easy, and I was reassured that I could do it.  After he explained it, and I remembered all of the basic things we had to do, I was able to work well and efficiently. I also remembered about the previous machines we had made, and was able to help the people around me, and save them some time.</td>

    <td>By next lesson I will have done half an hours work on it, and I should be able to get the basic code behind my quiz done in that time, and then I should be well prepared for next lesson if I am able to make it work properly and efficiently, which I should be able to do. The half an hours work will also ensure that I will not have a mind blank in the lesson monday, as my memory will have been refreshed, and I will be ready to get to work on my code, and get it working properly.</td>
