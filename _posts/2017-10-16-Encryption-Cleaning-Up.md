    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To create a program to encrypt and decrypt strings and make it clean and easy to use</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> Yes, and it works well. I can input a sentence and It will decode it, without any mess</td>

    <td>I had my complete program, that encoded, and decoded sentences that I put into it. Itv was not very simple to use though, and I had to put in the sentence that I wanted to encode in letter by letter. I wanted to be able to just put in a string, and it would break it up into letters, change them, and then concatenate it. I did this in a similar way to when I was decoding a string. I took the left however many letters, and then the rightmost letter.  This meant that I could have all of the separate letters, and then run them through all of the grid, and concatenate it.

After I had done this, I wanted to make it cleaner looking. To do this I opened a new sheet and then I made it so that it would just use the string from the new sheets box, and put the code in the system. For the decode, you just put the string in on the new sheet, and it would run it through the program and output the sentence on the new sheet.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It took a while to remember how to split up the letters successfully, but I managed to do it by looking at my older decoding code, and modifying it to use the new cells.   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson, it will be after half term, and so I will be able to probably start something new. I will use the skills that I have learnt in this encryption and decryption process, to make sure that I will learn the most.</td>
  </tr>
