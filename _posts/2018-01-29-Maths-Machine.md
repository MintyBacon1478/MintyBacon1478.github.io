    <td>We saw Mr. Keens repl, and he showed us how most of the code in his program was simply defining functions, and how them he just had to run one function, which called many others, to make an effective program. Because we were not making a game, we made a program that can run basic maths functions, again and again.  We created a program that gives you a list of 4 functions; add, subtract, multiply and divide, and then you had to choose 1 of them. Then it asked you for the 2 numbers you wanted to do the function on, and then worked it out. We had it set up in a loop, so it would let you do function after function, without having to re-run the whole program.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was able to get nearly all of my function running perfectly the first time I coded it, and so I was able to work very efficiently.  I ended up helping out others, as my code worked first time round, and so I did not have much to work on myself.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I am not sure what we will be doing next lesson, probably just using the knowledge of being able to define and call a function, </td>
