    <td>I had lost my quiz; I could not find it inside of my Repl.It document. I was nearly about to restart my entire quiz, yet I tired to find it one more time, and I was able to find my nearly finished quiz. This meant that I did not have to fully restart my quiz, and saved myself a lot of time. </td>

    <td>I spent around 10 minutes trying and successfully finding my quiz, I was able to start work on it again. I was able to get all of the question-asking section working, yet I could not get the ending, where it gives you our results to output. I could not figure out how to fix it, but I know what the problems with it are; all I need to know now is how to fix this.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson I will try and figure out how to solve the problem of the variables scores, by researching it on the internet and asking the people around me to try and fix it. Once that is done my quiz will be complete, and will work, just as long as I can fix this one problem.</td>
