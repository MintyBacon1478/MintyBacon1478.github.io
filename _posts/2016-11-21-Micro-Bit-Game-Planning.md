**Micro Bit Game: True or False**

In this game, you will have a snake character, and you will have to guide him around the obstacle course. Every level the course will change, and the snake will move faster and faster. You will move him with the arrow keys, and you will hold it to keep him going.

There will be only 1 player in this game, as it only has 1 snake.

You will move the snake with the arrow keys. The game will start on level one, and every level will have a new, pre-made map for you to adventure through.  The game will also know that the arrow keys are the movements.

The outputs for the game will be the snake moving through the game, and the course changing every level.
