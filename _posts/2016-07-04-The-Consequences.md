Today we learnt about the consequences of sexting and revenge porn.  We learnt it is never a good idea to sext, as it could even ruin your life!  Mr. Keen said that there could be things that happen to you, even after the law was done with you. People would make fun of you, and you could want to commit suicide.  If you made someone commit suicide, people would want revenge, and would even come after you!  The main lesson today was to never sext, as the consequences could ruin your life.
