    <td>I improved from last week, and made sure I typed the code we needed perfectly, including capital letters, as that slowed me down a bit last week.  I made sure that I followed the instructions, after thorough reading of them. This is because it can get very complicated if you do not read it properly, and this had caused problems in the past. </td>

    <td>Early in the lesson, I did not read the instructions properly, and I got stuck on a section called The Big If, and I spent lots more time than I needed to, and just sat there doing nothing.  I realised that would not help anything, so I went back and read previous sections properly.  If I had read them properly, I would not have to go back and read them again.  </td>
