    <td>I simply carried on from last lesson on my work, but we stopped to be told about our work ethic.  We were told that we could not just tell each other the answers to the code; it was cheating.  It is because then you are simply telling them what to do and they are not learning.  For example, if it was maths instead of IT, you would just be giving them the number, so now you can understand what it does for your learning.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt that in binary, capital A is different to capital a, and so in code it is normally important to type exactly what the instructions say, or the code will come across to the computer as wrong.  I did not realise this, and so I wasted some time. Now I know, and so I can stop wasting time.</td>

    <td>Next lesson, I will get further into my code, and I will look forward to it.  I will follow the instructions exactly, and so I will get further than before, and not waste time on capital letters and spelling.</td>
