    <td>I made an empty sheets, and we went over many basic cyphers and what they were used for. We learnt about different techniques, like the caesar cypher and using a codeword to put at the beginning of the translator bank of information.  We then thought about how we could build a machine to encrypt it, and we then learnt about using =vlookup, to translate whatever was in the boxes, without us having to do it ourselves. We told it to go to the second column, from the two columns of original letters to jumbles up letters. It would find the original letter, and then go across 1 column, and find whatever letter it now was. I learnt a lot  </td>

    <td>I feel like I did very well in the lesson and learnt a lot.  I listened well, and so I was able to understand what was going on, and so I didn't waste much time in the lesson, even though figuring the decryption code was tricky.</td>

    <td>Next time, I will try and be more independent, as for the decryption part, I worked with the people around me a lot, and so was a bit distracted, and so maybe I might have gotten more done, but even then I still managed to finish on time</td>
