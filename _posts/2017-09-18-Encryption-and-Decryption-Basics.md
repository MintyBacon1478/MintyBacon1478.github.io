    <td>We had the basic encrypter, and I made the part of it that decrypts work properly. I added another column to my sheet, and it worked well. I also added some code to make sure that if there was no code in the box, there was nothing else in the box below, and that made it look nicer.  I made it also "concatenate" the code together, so that I can have all of the letters put together in code.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I feel like I did very well in the lesson and learnt a lot.  I listened well, and so I was able to understand what was going on, and so I didn't waste much time in the lesson, even though figuring the decryption code was tricky.  We missed a bit at the start of the lesson, so I could have done more, but I will next time</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will try and be more independent, as for the decryption part, I worked with the people around me a lot, and so was a bit distracted, and so maybe I might have gotten more done, but even then I still managed to finish on time. Next week we will not miss a bit a the start, and this will let me get more done.</td>
