    <td>Today we were told that we all needed to get our blogs working. Mr Keen told us all of the main problems people had told him about, and they were mainly our human errors in typing or changing the looks of the blog.  He told us all what to do, and how to fix our mistakes.  Some people's blogs, due to technical errors, were using the wrong code so they had to start again.</td>

    <td>Today I had fixed my blog, and changed some things about it quite quickly.  Unfortunately, my partner, George, had not finished so fast and his blog was severely broken, and so we couldn't work together on the fuze box.  This meant that i was not able to do much this lesson.</td>
