    <td>I got a bit sidetracked, and so I tried to improve my github blog, but I broke something in it, and so I spent some time fixing it and getting it back to normal, and so I had to discard all of my changes.  This meant that I had wasted quite a lot of time and made no progress, and so I went back to codecademy.</td>
