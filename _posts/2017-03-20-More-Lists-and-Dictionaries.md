    <td>I carried on with python, and I learnt a lot about lists and dictionaries.  It was very interesting, and I enjoyed it a lot.  You have to modify the key and the original word, and it is very easy.  Next lesson I will have learnt a lot more, shown by my practice diary.</td>

    <td>I had to go back a few exercises to check how to add some parts to the list. This took some time, and now I understand it. I had to spend quite a lot of time to go back, and re-learn it. This might have taken a lot of time, a=and could have been avoided. </td>
