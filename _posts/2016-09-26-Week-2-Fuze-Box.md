    <td>I learnt by working together with George. We had one of us at the computer, and the other one reading out code, which worked very well.  We then swapped over halfway through the lesson.  This worked well as otherwise, one of us would be working slowly and reading, and the other one would be doing nothing and being bored.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Setting up today limited my learning, as we took a bit too long to get ready.  We also took rather a long time putting our parts away as well.  Other than this we were not back by much, and we had solved most of our problems last week.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time George and I will spend more time writing code, and less time actually testing it.  We spent about 10 minutes testing our code, and so we lost some time we could have spent creating new programs to learn more.  This probably held us up a bit, but we found it very amusing to test them after we had made and fixed the code.</td>
