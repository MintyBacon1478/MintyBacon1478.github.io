    <td>We did some buzzfeed quizzes, and then had a talk about how they could possibly work and figure out what 'Whatever" you are from it.  This could be done in many ways, like weighted answers, or if you answered mostly a's or b’s, it would give you different answers.  We then went back to our places, and tried to create our own questions and describe the logic behind it.  My quiz was, ‘What type of musician are you?”</td>

    <td>It took me a while to think of a good question, and I was not able to finish all of my questions in the lesson.  I found it very easy to describe the logic though, as it is based on the idea of if you got mostly a’s, then… etc. so it was not very had to work out the logic behind the system</td>
