    <td>I carried on from last week, and I made sure that I read all of the instructions thoroughly, as that slowed me down last week.  This week I kept working, and I got to 28%, but I was further on as I was near to the end.  I got stuck on a few questions, but carried on trying new methods, and carried on.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>This week I got a bit distracted, and lost focus. This was partly to do with the fact that Mr. Keen had not spoken directly to us any instructions. He had not given us any direct work, but just said to get on with our work.</td>

    <td>Next lesson, we will get further, and I will be on at least 30% by then by doing 1 exercise a day.  I will concentrate more, and get to at least 33% I hope.  </td>
