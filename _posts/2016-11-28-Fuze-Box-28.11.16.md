    <td>George and I looked at each others blogs, and we said what could be improved, and what was good about it. We then moved on to the code for our robot arms. We were following on from last week, so already had done a lot of the work. When we tried the code however, we could not input commands into the system to move the arm.  Because of this, there was nothing to film, and so no youtube video/link.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>George and I couldn't get our code working, so we both got quite frustrated, and so we slowed down on fixing it a bit. This meant we didn't get as much as normal done, so we could try harder to fix it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson george and I will have more time to identify the problem in our code, and so we will also ask other people who have their code right what theirs looks like compared to ours.  This will probably get our code working, and so then we can get the video we need.</td>
