**Working On The Fuze Book:07/11/16**

Starting Point: Page 55

Target For The Lesson: Page 60

Did I Reach This: Yes, and by quite a good amount.(10)

**Lesson Review:**

**How Did I learn:**

George and I learnt by one of us reding out the code, and one of us typing it. This is effective, as we are both working as hard as each other, at the same time. But Now We are near the end, we are working faster and more efficiently, getting more done. We learnt about light sequences, random numbers and how to ask a question and have someone answer it.  It was very productive, and we learnt a lot more than what we would normally learn.

**What Limited My Learning, And How I Could Stop That Habit:**

We Worked very hard today, as we wanted to finish the book. We got  bit distracted by other groups playing with robots, but we will be on them soon so we need to concentrate., to try and get to that stage. A good self-motivator

**How Will I Work Next Time:**

Next lesson we have agreed on some more words, so we don't have to say the entire line, but we will both understand each other. This will be good as it will save time, and make it easier to talk to each other, faster, so we can work on our robot arm!
