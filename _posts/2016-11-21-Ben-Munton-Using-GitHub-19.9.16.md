    <td>I learnt that working together with George was very effective as he was reading out some of the code, and I was typing it, and we swapped over many times. This was better as last week we were only doing one of us working at a time, with the other one being bored and doing nothing</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We were behind some other groups as we did not make much progress, as we took too long reading the manual. George was very slow reading it, and so we did not start until much later.
This meant we were much slower to start coding, and everyone else started while we were reading</td>

    <td>Next lesson we will be faster to start working, as today we were a bit later starting on our code as we had forgotten to plug a cable in, and we will know about it this next lesson, so there will be no delay. This means we will start faster, and get more work done in the lesson </td>
