    <td>I created an account, and got straight into the coding process. I read all of the tutorials on every stage, as that can be a stage that many boys leave out, and can damage your learning.  
I learnt many new terms, like str() and print.  It was very interesting, and I look forward to it next week.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

    <td>For some parts, I did not type everything correctly(like capital letters), and did not follow the tutorial exactly. I have learnt from this, as it put me a few minutes behind everyone else.</td>

    <td>Next lesson, I will get further into my code, and I will look forward to it.  I will follow the instructions exactly, and so I will get further than before.</td>
