    <td>We all started on codecademy, and I managed to complete an excercise beforr Mr. Keen came around to check all of our blogs. He noticed that for all of our blogs, for the people with working tables, that all of them were one colour.  He called us all to the front, and I then learnt that you can change the colours of individual boxes. All you need to do is change "td" to "th" and specify what colour you want those boxes to be. We were also shown how to add YouTube videos into our blogs.</td>

    <td>I was one of the first to try to modify the tables, and because I was listening well I knew how to do it. I managed to change the colour, but I wasn't reading the colours properly and thinking it through. I accidentally changed the font to the same colour as the 2nd boxes, and so you couldn't read most of it. I managed to fix it by going back through my code, however it did not register properly, and so I had to be patient and wait for it. It didn't happen for a while, and so I got worried it had broken, and so I changed it all to different shades of blue, but my changes came though, and it looks strange, so next time I should be more patient.</td>
