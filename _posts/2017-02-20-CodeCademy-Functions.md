    <td>I was very close to the end of my sections, and so I was working very hard to try and reach the end, so I could reach a new section.  I understand how to "def" a function, and you do it by saying def, and then naming your function. After this, inside brackets you say that arguments it takes, and then a colon. Underneath, you press tab, and say what the function “returns”</td>

    <td>I worked very hard, and so not much limited my learning.  I got stuck a bit further on, but this is just because it was a new section, and I could not fully understand it.</td>
