Today we were talking about how newspapers, governments and other media sources influence us.  We looked at lots of newspaper headlines, and advertisements, to see if they were propaganda or not. We learnt many of the different types and methods of propaganda, and what types of adverts they were used in, and we discussed what they did to us and how they made us want to do stuff. These included using famous people, ordinary people, and bending statistics to make people believe certain things. It really made you think about how much propaganda you had believed, and fallen for.
