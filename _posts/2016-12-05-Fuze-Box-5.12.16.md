    <td>George and I worked on our code, but we could not get the controls working. It would just have a string of numbers typed out, that we wanted to control with.  We asked some other people, and if we could look at which order their code and the order it is in.  We realised what we had done wrong, and we managed to get our code working. We then tested the arm, and got a feel for it. </td>
