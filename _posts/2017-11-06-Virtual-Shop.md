    <td>We talked about how these programs work in shops, and how we could create one in google sheets.  We took around 10 items, and then gave them all varying prices.  Then, we created a drop down list of these items, so that we could select them properly, and not spell each one of them wrong.  Then with the selection, we used vlookup to find its price in the table we made at the start.

Then we chose a quantity of each of the items, and put it next to the price that we used vlookup to find. Then we multiplied the quantity by the price, to find the amount spent on this item.  Finally, we added all of the prices together, to get the total price for all of the products.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>It took me a while to remember how to use vlookup, and make it so that it did not give out an error message at the end, so that we could add it all up.  To help with this, I went back to the encryption that we had done previously, and remembered how to use it without it giving us an error message at the end.</td>
