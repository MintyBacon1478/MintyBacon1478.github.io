    <td>I had lost all my progress on my sheet, all of my work was not there. I had to go back to a version from 2 weeks ago. I had to replace all my price calculations and then had to make a discount system, which worked very well.  I had decimals that you multiply the price by, and if the code was an exact copy of the preset code, you price was multiplied smaller.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I had to nearly completely restart my sheet, so I had to spend a significant amount of time getting the work back and making sure it worked well.  I was still able to get the discount codes working though, so i think that I made good progress in the lesson.</td>

    <td>Next lesson we will add to the program, but I will have remembered how to use vlookup and the basic functions, so the lesson should go well.  I will also have all of my code again, so i will be able to get more things in the Virtual Shop</td>
