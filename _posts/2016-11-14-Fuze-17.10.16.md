**Working Through The Fuze Book:17/10/16**

Starting Point: Page 39

Target For The Lesson: Page 50

Did I Reach This: Yes, by 5

**Lesson Review:**

**How Did I learn:**

George and I learnt by one of us reding out the code, and one of us typing it. Almost everyone is doing this now, and Mr Ampah-Korsah recommends it now. This is effective, as we are both working as hard as each other, at the same time.  It was a good strategy for ensuring both people work as hard as each other.

**What Limited My Learning, And How I Could Stop That Habit:**

Today, some of our code was typed wrong, and this was due to miscommunication. We need to work on our communication of code, to improve on this, and make sure it doesn't happen again.

**How Will I Work Next Time:**

Next lesson we have agreed on some more words, so we don't have to say the entire line.  This will be good as it will save time, and make it easier to talk to each other, faster, improving productivity.
