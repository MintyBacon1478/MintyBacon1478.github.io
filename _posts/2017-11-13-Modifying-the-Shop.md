    <td>We thought about how shops do deals, and how we could make it mostly computionsl on how the sheet does this.  We thought about how to could make buy one get one free deals and other costs that are realistic, and used in the real world.  We thought about how we could implement them, and we then tried to do it ourselves.  I managed to put in various shipping options, and a drop down list for them.  I also tried to put in a discount of any price that you put in, if you bought enough items.</td>

    <td>I was not able to get the discount working, as it was giving me an error for some reason.  I could not figure out why, but I think that I will be able to fix it next lesson, as it should have been relatively simple</td>
