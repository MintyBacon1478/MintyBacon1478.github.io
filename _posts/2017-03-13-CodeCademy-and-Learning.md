    <td>I was simply carrying on from last week, and I had been practising, I was able to make a lot of progress. I learnt about dictionaries, and how to add and remove items and their values from them. I learnt a lot, and am very happy with my progress. It was a very productive lesson.</td>

    <td>I got a bit distracted, as there was something wrong with my computer. It was preventing me from changing my keyboard from US to UK, and so I spent a lot of time trying to fix it, but I wasnt able to, so I had actually wasted a lot of time.  I will stay on task next time.</td>
